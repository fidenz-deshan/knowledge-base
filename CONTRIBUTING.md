# Contributing Guide

1. Make sure you put things in the right category!
2. If you think something belongs in the wrong category, or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to edit things too.
3. You have other resources to expand this knowledge base? Feel free to add them as a revision!
4. AVOID MAKING CHANGES DIRECTLY TO `master` AND `revisions` BRANCHES.

## Revisioning Guide

When doing revisions (adding, modifying, removing content) follow the following guide lines to keep things nice and clean.

1. Create a branch named `rev/[VERSION OR A NAME FOR THE REVISION]`.
2. Use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io) or [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) if you are using VSCode to write in markdown.
3. Bump the version and tag.
4. Create a PR and set the base branch to `revisions`.
5. Have few contributors to review and approve your new revision and merge.

## Reporting issues

If you find any kind of typos, mistakes, etc create an issue addressing the issue. 

If you are feeling like fixing the issue yourself, feel free to make the fix yourself by following the above guide. Contributors will review and merge in the PR.
