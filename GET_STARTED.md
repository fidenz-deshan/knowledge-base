# Get Started

We understand that you are quite eagerly waiting to start with your training and learn all the awesome things you can get your hands on. But its very important for you to go through this first.

## General

 1. Read the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
 2. When you come across any errors, issues. Try to Google them yourself first before consulting a senior developer. Go through [How To Google](General/HOW_TO_GOOGLE.md) guide to learn how to properly use Google search.
 3. Fidenz Academy Knowledge Base contains official documentations, guides, tutorials as learning material. This is because 3rd party guides, video tutorials might get outdated and we cannot always update them.
