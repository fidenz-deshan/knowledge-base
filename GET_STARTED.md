# Get Started

We understand that you are quite eagerly waiting to start with your training and learn all the awesome things you can get your hands on. But its very important for you to go through this first.

## General

1. When you come across any errors, issues. Try to Google them yourself first before consulting a senior developer. Go through [How To Google](General/HOW_TO_GOOGLE.md) guide to learn how to properly use Google search.
2. If you find any errors in the program or would like to contribute to the resource go ahead and read the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Going through the training program

Fidenz Academy Knowledge Base contains official documentations, guides, tutorials as learning resources. This is because 3rd party guides, video tutorials might get outdated. You might put hours into learning something without realizing that it has been outdated until its too late. If you were to follow any 3rd party tutorials that are outside of this knowledge base always make sure that they contain valid and up-to-date content.

You will be given a set of technologies to start in the training program by Fidenz. Make sure to stick to the program and go through given tutorials/guides.

Feel free to go through other tutorials and guides that are not included in our program but make sure to finish the program curriculum before that.

1. Program will contain certain links that are only for Fidenz Trainees. Make sure that you have received access to Fidenz Academy Internal Knowledge Base.
2. A program will be divided as following.

### Curriculum

## Submitting assignments

Through the course of your training program you will be given few assignments. An assignment will content a problem and a git repository for you to submit your answer. We have a good [Git Guide](General/GIT.md) for you!

When submitting an assignment make sure to use a separate branch other than the `master` and create a PR/MR (pull request / merge request) of your branch then set `master` as the base branch.

When you were given feedback make sure to go through all of them, reply to them, and make necessary adjustments to your source code before requesting a review again.
