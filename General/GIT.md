# GIT 101

> "I find your lack of knowledge in Git disturbing."
> Darth Vader, 1980

The above takes place when Lord Vader found out his colleague Motti (junior developer) didn't know [what is a VCS](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) and Lord Vader gave his a good lecture on [what is Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git) (while force choking him).

Git is the most important tool in a developer's arsenal. It is important to get it right at the very beginning of your journey as a developer!

## Curriculum

You might have heard and used tools such as Github Desktop, SourceTree, GitKraken, TortoiseGit, etc. All of the Git clients use the Git CLI tool under the hood. So it's better to learn that before everything else.
